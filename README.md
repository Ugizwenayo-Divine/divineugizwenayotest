A client is requesting you to create a system that would allow them to digitize his quizzing business where he will allow users to get questions  from the system, and they answer them. The system automatically corrects them using answer sheets in the system and gives them their performance results. They can come back to the system and view their past marks.


The system will have three different types of questions:
Multiple choice questions(Where a user chooses one or many answers from many options)
For ex: What is the capital city of Rwanda
                       1. Kigali
                       2. Nairobi
                       3. Musanze
                       4. Nairobi
Filling empty space questions(Where a user fills one or many empty spaces in a sentence and the system will checks their inputs)
 For ex: ---------------------- is the capital city of Rwanda, which has a population of -------------. Rwanda has got its independence in -------------------
Matching each empty space with the right choice from a variety of choices listed
For ex: The water molecule is symbolize by ---------(H20,H2SO4, Mg), it very abundant on earth where it compounds about -------(71%,28%,20%,50%) of earth’s surface

The system backend must perform auto-correction on it’s own, no user interaction. The system owner must also have ways of adding new questions to his system and deleting them. After analyzing the core functionalities of this solution create a working version that highlights the things listed above. You have a maximum of  2 weeks to submit, remember as soon as you showcase your skills and pass, you will be enrolled immediately.

Notice: Use any technologies you deem would help you fulfill this assignment accordingly, the goal is to assess how you solve real life problems digitally, you can host your solution either on heroku or any other place on the cloud, you may also have it on your personal machine on your presentation day.
